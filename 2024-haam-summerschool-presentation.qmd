# Genetic Drift

- Random process of allele frequency change.
- Wright-Fisher model:
  - Parent generation of $N$ individuals
  - Exactly $N$ individuals as next generation.
  - Parents drawn randomly per child
  - results in binomial random draws.

## Example
- $N=100$ (haploid individuals)
- two alleles $A$ and $B$
- Generation 1: 50 $A$, 50 $B$, so allele freuqency of $B$ is 50%.
- Generation 2: 47 $A$, 53 $B$, so allele freuqency of $B$ is 53%.

## Simulation
Implementation in R:

```{R echo=TRUE, `code-line-numbers` = "|1|2|3|4-6|"} 
wfsim <- function(n, g, x0) {
  res <- numeric(g + 1)
  res[1] <- x0
  for (i in 2:(g + 1)) {
    res[i] <- (rbinom(1, n, res[i - 1])) / n
  }
  return(res)
}
```

We can test it:

```{R echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
wfsim(100, 10, 0.5)
```

--- 

```{R echo=TRUE}
time_series <- wfsim(100, 100, 0.5)
plot(time_series, type = "l", ylim = c(0, 1),
     xlab = "generation", ylab = "allele frequency")
```

---

```{R echo=TRUE}
gens <- 100
sims100 <- replicate(50, wfsim(100, gens, 0.5))
matplot(sims100, type = "l", lty = 1, col = "black",
        ylim = c(0, 1),
        xlab = "generation", ylab = "allele frequency")
```

- Variance increases with time
- eventually absorption at $x=0$ or $x=1$ ("fixation")

---

How does this process depend on the population size? We can take a look. Here are three families of simulations, with three different population sizes:

```{R fig.height=4, fig.width=9}
gens <- 1000
sims100 <- replicate(50, wfsim(100, gens, 0.5))
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
matplot(sims100, type = "l", lty = 1, col = "black",
        xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 1),
        xlab = "generation", ylab = "allele frequency", main = "N = 100")

sims1000 <- replicate(50, wfsim(1000, gens, 0.5))
matplot(sims1000, type = "l", lty = 1, col = "black",
        xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 1),
        xlab = "generation", ylab = "allele frequency", main = "N = 1000")

sims10000 <- replicate(50, wfsim(10000, gens, 0.5))
matplot(sims10000, type = "l", lty = 1, col = "black",
        xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 1),
        xlab = "generation", ylab = "allele frequency", main = "N = 10000")
```

This shows that larger populations have weaker fluctuations than small populations.

### $F_\text{ST}$ quantifies genetic drift

To quantify genetic drift, we can measure the variance of this process over time. The following plot uses the same data as shown above and estimates the variance:

```{R fig.height=4, fig.width=9}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(apply(sims100,   1, var), type = "l", ylim = c(0, 0.25),
     xlab = "generations", ylab = "Variance", main = "N = 100")
plot(apply(sims1000,  1, var), type = "l", ylim = c(0, 0.25),
     xlab = "generations", ylab = "Variance", main = "N = 1000")
plot(apply(sims10000, 1, var), type = "l", ylim = c(0, 0.25),
     xlab = "generations", ylab = "Variance", main = "N = 10000")

```

so an increasing variance. But it doesn't go up forever, but reaches a plateau. This is because of fixation: Once all curves reach fixaton at either $x=0$ or $x=1$, variance does no longer increase. In fact, the maximum variance corresponds to the state where all curves have been fixed. The variance to that state corresponds to the variance of a Bernoulli-process, which is $x_0(1-x_0)$, so it depends on the starting frequency.

It is this plateau of the variance that defines $F_\text{ST}=1$! Here is an illustration using again three families of simulations, but this time with the same population size but different starting frequencies:

```{R}
sims_x05 <- replicate(1000, wfsim(100, gens, 0.5))
sims_x03 <- replicate(1000, wfsim(100, gens, 0.3))
sims_x02 <- replicate(1000, wfsim(100, gens, 0.2))

plot_dat <- cbind(
  apply(sims_x05, 1, var),
  apply(sims_x03, 1, var),
  apply(sims_x02, 1, var)
)

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

cols <- c("blue", "red", "green")
matplot(plot_dat, type = "l", ylim = c(0, 0.25), lty = 1,
             xlab = "generations", ylab = "Variance", col = cols)
legend(x = "bottomright",
       legend = c("x = 0.5", "x = 0.3", "x = 0.2", "FST = 1"),
       lty = c(1, 1, 1, 2), col = c(cols, "black"))

theory_values <- sapply(c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2), function(x) x * (1 - x))
abline(h = theory_values, lty = 2, col = cols)
```

### Formal definition of $F_\text{ST}$

[@Weir2002] (explained and summarised in [@Bhatia2013]) give a more formal evolutionary definition of $F_\text{ST}$, in terms of covariance between derived and ancestral populations. Specifically, for a given SNP, the definition involves the conditional probability of allele frequency $p_i$ in population $i$, given an ancestral allele frequency $p_\text{anc}$, which is defined as a random process with the expectation

$$E(p_i|p_\text{anc}) = p_\text{anc}$$

and variance $$Var(p_i|p_\text{anc}) = F_\text{ST}^i p_\text{anc}(1-p_\text{anc}).$$

This form of the conditional variance can be understood by analysing the equation for the two boundary cases: For $F_\text{ST}^i=0$, there is no variance, so the conditional probability of the derived frequency will be completely determined by the ancestral frequency with no random change. In contrast $F_\text{ST}^i=1$ means that the variance in the derived allele frequency is that of a binomial distribution with variance $p_\text{anc}(1-p_\text{anc})$, indicating random but complete fixation of the frequency to 0 or 1.

$F_\text{ST}$ between two populations A and B is then defined as $$F_\text{ST}(A,B) = \frac{F_\text{ST}^A+F_\text{ST}^B}{2}$$.

### Estimating $F_\text{ST}$ from genomic data

While there are various mathematical definitions for both the theoretical definition and estimation for $F_\text{ST}$, which differ in subtle ways, we here follow the excellent paper by [@Bhatia2013], which proposes the following estimator, termed Hudson-estimator, which in turn is based on a proposal by [@Hudson1992] and has been implemented in the ADMIXTOOLS package [@Patterson2012]:

$$F_\text{ST}=1-\frac{H_w}{H_b}$$

Here, $H_w$ is the average heterozygosity within each population, and $H_b$ is the average heterozygosity between two populations. We can easily read off the two boundaries of the definition: At the lower end, we have $F_\text{ST}=0$ if and only if $H_w=H_b$, so there is no difference between heterozygosity measured within or between groups, which is equivalent to saying that the two populations are the same. On the upper end we have $F_\text{ST}=1$ if and only if $H_w=0$, so all observed variants are fully fixed in both populations (but not necessarily different between the populations).

It is fairly straight forward to see (and shown in [@Bhatia2013]) that the Hudson-estimator above can be recast as

$$F_\text{ST}(A,B)=\frac{(a-b)^2}{a(1-b)+b(1-a)}$$

Here, $a$ and $b$ denote _population allele frequencies_, which are in principle unobserved, but can be approximated by _sample allele frequencies_. This approximation is biased, and [@Patterson2012] gives additional formulae for an (asympotically) unbiased estimator (which is for example also used in Poseidon's tool xerxes, as detailed in the [whitepaper](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-analysis-hs/blob/main/docs/xerxes_whitepaper.pdf)).

From this definition, you can see that $F_\text{ST}(A,B)$ is closely related to F2-statistics, introduced in [@Patterson2012]:

$$F_2(A,B)=(a-b)^2$$.

In some sense, $F_\text{ST}(A,B)$ can be considered a normalised version of $F_2(A,B)$. While both statistics range mathematically from 0 to 1, the upper bound 1 has very different meanings in both. A theoretical value of $F_2=1$ would mean that both populations are fixed at different alleles in all studied SNPs, which is practically not possible (even completely random fixations would suggest that 1/4 of them would agree given that there are only four nucleotides, let alone the fact that such deeply diverged populations/species would not be alignable anymore). One can say that the time-scale on which $F_2$ approaches 1, for non-ascertained SNPs, so the entire genome, is the time scale of nucleotide substitutions (i.e. mutations plus fixation) along species branches, which in neutral evolution is given by the inverse mutation rate $1/\mu$. This would mean something on the order of $10^8$ generations, which is arguably of the same order of magnitude as the depth of the entire tree of life. In contrast, $F_\text{ST}$ approaches 1 on the time-scale of fixation of standing variation, which is $2N$ generations, which for humans is on the order of 10000 generations, so around the depth of modern-human diversity from its origins in Africa several hundred thousand years ago. Arguably, this time scale is much more useful for data analyses and thus easier to interpret.

Of course, in practice, one uses some ascertained SNP set, as also here in our examples below, in which case values are much higher because we consider only variants that are segregating in human populations within a relatively high allele frequency.

If you've gone through our [chapter on F3 and F4 statistics](fstats.qmd), you will have already encountered our software [xerxes](https://www.poseidon-adna.org/#/xerxes?id=xerxes-cli-software). You can compute both the biased and the approximately unbiased estimators for $F_\text{ST}(A,B)$, using the `FST` or `FSTvanilla` statistics, as defined in the [whitepaper](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-analysis-hs/blob/main/docs/xerxes_whitepaper.pdf).

For what follows, we will use the approximately unbiased form `FST`.

$F_\text{ST}(A,B)$ has a convenient and untuitive scale: It ranges from 0 to 1, where $F_\text{ST}(A,B)=0$ denotes that $A$ and $B$ are the _same_ population, with no differentiation whatsoever. On the other hand of the spectrum we have $F_\text{ST}(A,B)=1$, which would mean that two populations are fully separated.

Another way to see this measure is to consider it as _relative shared variance_: If you consider genetic variation _between_ $A$ and $B$, and _within_ each of $A$ and $B$, then $F_\text{ST}(A,B)$ can be considered to measure the average variance _between_ populations relative to the average variance _within_ populations, again with intuitive boundaries 0 and 1.

## Computing FST using xerxes

For human present-day populations, we can compute pairwise FSt using [xerxes](https://www.poseidon-adna.org/#/xerxes?id=xerxes-cli-software).

We here chose a number of populations from [@Patterson2012] with more than 10 samples per population, and prepare the following config file for xerxes:

```Yaml
fstats:
- type: FST
  a: ["Adygei", "Balochi", "Basque", "BedouinA", "BedouinB", "Biaka", "Brahui", "Burusho", "Druze", "French", "Han", "Hazara", "Italian_North", "Japanese", "Kalash", "Karitiana", "Makrani", "Mandenka", "Mayan", "Mozabite", "Orcadian", "Palestinian", "Papuan", "Pathan", "Pima", "Russian", "Sardinian", "Sindhi_Pakistan", "Yakut", "Yoruba"]
  b: ["Adygei", "Balochi", "Basque", "BedouinA", "BedouinB", "Biaka", "Brahui", "Burusho", "Druze", "French", "Han", "Hazara", "Italian_North", "Japanese", "Kalash", "Karitiana", "Makrani", "Mandenka", "Mayan", "Mozabite", "Orcadian", "Palestinian", "Papuan", "Pathan", "Pima", "Russian", "Sardinian", "Sindhi_Pakistan", "Yakut", "Yoruba"]
- type: F2
  a: ["Adygei", "Balochi", "Basque", "BedouinA", "BedouinB", "Biaka", "Brahui", "Burusho", "Druze", "French", "Han", "Hazara", "Italian_North", "Japanese", "Kalash", "Karitiana", "Makrani", "Mandenka", "Mayan", "Mozabite", "Orcadian", "Palestinian", "Papuan", "Pathan", "Pima", "Russian", "Sardinian", "Sindhi_Pakistan", "Yakut", "Yoruba"]
  b: ["Adygei", "Balochi", "Basque", "BedouinA", "BedouinB", "Biaka", "Brahui", "Burusho", "Druze", "French", "Han", "Hazara", "Italian_North", "Japanese", "Kalash", "Karitiana", "Makrani", "Mandenka", "Mayan", "Mozabite", "Orcadian", "Palestinian", "Papuan", "Pathan", "Pima", "Russian", "Sardinian", "Sindhi_Pakistan", "Yakut", "Yoruba"]
```

This will then produce all combinations of $FST(A, B)$ and $F_2(A, B)$ as indicated in the population lists.

:::{.callout-note}
Note that the config-file engine in xerxes always computes _all_ the combinations of populations, even for cases of $A=B$. It also doesn't know about symmetry, so will happily compute the redundant statistics $FST(\text{Adygei}, \text{Adygei})$ and $FST(\text{Adygei}, \text{Adygei})$. While this could be possibly improved, there is no big harm done, as this runs fairly quickly.
:::

We run this config file using the command line

```bash
REPO=/path/to/community-archive/2012_PattersonGenetics

xerxes fstats -d $REPO --statConfig fstat_world_config.yaml -f fstat_world_output.tsv > fstat_world_table.txt
```

The standard output, is a nicely layouted ASCII Table, which looks like this in the beginning:

```

but of course has many more lines (>1800 in this case). We also used the `-f` flag to output a tab-separated file, here named `fstat_world_output.tsv`, which is easier to read into R.

## Plotting results in R

All of the following code uses strictly only base-R for maximum compatibility. The code should run on any R installation.

We first load the data

```{r}
dat <- dat <- subset(read.table("fst_working/fstat_world_output.tsv", sep="\t", header = TRUE),
                     select=-c(c, d, Z_score_Jackknife))
datFST <- dat[dat$Statistic == "FST",]
datF2 <- dat[dat$Statistic == "F2",]
head(datFST)
```

Ok, this looks good. Let's check out the largest values

```{r}
head(dat[order(-dat$Estimate_Total),])
```

which shows that the largest FST values of around 0.3 are observed between Karitiana, from South America, and Biaka from Papua Neu Guinea (but note that these values are dependent on the ascertainment of SNPs, which here causes inflation)

Here is a histogram of the values

```{r}
hist(datFST$Estimate_Total, xlab = "FST", ylab = "Nr of pairs",
     main = "")
```

So most values are in the range of a few percent and 20 percent, with a mean of

```{r}
mean(datFST$Estimate_Total)
```

We can compare that to F2:

```{r}
hist(datF2$Estimate_Total, xlab = "F2", ylab = "Nr of pairs",
     main = "")
```

which is an order of magnitude smaller.

So one of the key things to visualise is the pairwise matrix of FST, which we can quickly compute using the `xtabs` function from the stats package (part of base R):

```{r}
fstMat <- xtabs(Estimate_Total ~ a + b, datFST)
f2Mat <- xtabs(Estimate_Total ~ a + b, datF2)
```

and plot a simple heatmap using the powerful `heatmap` function from the stats package:

```{r}
#| fig-height: 7
#| fig-width: 7
heatmap(fstMat, symm = TRUE, hclustfun = function(m) hclust(m, method="ward.D2"))
```

which we can compare to the output using F2, which looks almost the same:

```{r}
#| fig-height: 7
#| fig-width: 7
heatmap(f2Mat, symm = TRUE, hclustfun = function(m) hclust(m, method="ward.D2"))
```
OK, let's look at the dendrogram a bit closer:

```{r}
#| fig-height: 7
#| fig-width: 7
fstDist <- as.dist(fstMat)
dendro <- hclust(fstDist, method="ward.D2")
plot(dendro, hang = -1, ylab = "FST", xlab = "", main = "")
```
which again shows the strong drift that Native American populations (Karitiana) and Mayans experienced in their ancestral past. 

This nicely shows how FST is affected by total drift, which is inversely proportional to population size, and proportional to total divergence time. A long branch can be caused by either low population size (as in the ancestral population of indigenous Americans) or long divergence time (as between populations from Africa and those outside of Africa).
